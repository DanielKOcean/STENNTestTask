# STENNTestTask
Test task for position "Junior C# Developer" at STENN

Hello, colleagues.

I worked on your test task and decided to implement it as a class library with tests and small benchmark (yes, I've been interested in differen `GetHashCode()` implementation performance). Take a look, any way I'll be pleased to hear your feedback.

Run tests (from project folder):
```
dotnet test
```

Launch bench (from path `benchmarks\STENNTestTask.Benchmarks`):
```
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Best regards, Ivan.
